# password-generator
## description
My motivation to do this project is learning more about javascript, experiment with different codes and improve my skills. I built this project to create a password-generator this can be used to make random password combination. I challenged my imagination and compared the different uses of my code.
I addeded questions to make the password accesible to everybody on their on conditions
My project is a web page that includes a box that displays or generates a secure password with a random combination of numbers, special characters, and upper or low characters, also has a specific number of characters.
